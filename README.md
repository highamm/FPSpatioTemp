This repository contains working code and ideas for the paper "An Application of Spatio-temporal Modeling to Finite Population Abundance Prediction." The data, provided by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, that is used in the paper can be found at `/data/moose_14_20.rda`.

The vignette in `/vignettes` shows how to fit the model to a particular data set with the functions in `/R`.
